# Sorting_Visualizer

## 🧑‍💻 Implemented Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort** 
2. **Selection Sort** 
3. **Insertion Sort** 
4. **Merge Sort** 
5. **Quick Sort** 
6. **Heap Sort** 

## 🎨 Features

### 1. **Colored Representation of Sorting Steps**
The visualizations use color coding to represent the state of the array as the sorting algorithms work:
- **🔵 Blue:** Default (initial state of the array)
- **🟡 Yellow:** Elements being compared
- **🔴 Red:** Elements identified as in incorrect positions and need to be moved
- **🟢 Green:** Element in its correct position

### 2. **Controls for Customizing Visualization**
- **⚡ Speed of Visualization:** Choose from 5 speed levels to adjust how fast the algorithm runs.
- **📊 Data Size:** Adjust the number of elements in the array to be sorted.
- **🎲 Generate New Data:** Randomly generate new data to visualize different sorting scenarios.

### 3. **Performance Metrics**
- **🕒 Time Complexity:** Displays the time complexity of the algorithm being visualized.
- **💾 Space Complexity:** Displays the space complexity of the algorithm being visualized.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML** 🖥️: For the basic structure of the web application.
- **CSS** 🎨: For styling and creating a visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript** 💻: For implementing the sorting algorithms and handling the interactive aspects of the visualization.
